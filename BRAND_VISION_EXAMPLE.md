## Brand Name

Nordic Bloom Candles

## Mission Statement

We craft hand-poured soy candles that bring the calm of Nordic nature into Danish homes.
Every candle is made with care — simple ingredients, honest scents, no shortcuts.

## Target Audience

**Primary audience:**
Danish women aged 25-45 who value quality home products and conscious consumption.
They buy from small, local businesses when possible, follow Scandinavian interior accounts,
and treat candles as everyday home decor — not just gifts.

**Secondary audience:**
Gift buyers (partners, friends) looking for a thoughtful, premium gift that feels personal
and local — not mass-produced.

## Brand Voice

| Quality | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Tone | Calm, warm, and honest — like a conversation with a trusted friend |
| Language | Simple and sensory — we describe scents and moods, not features |
| Personality | The knowledgeable artisan who loves what they make |
| Avoid | Corporate language, "luxury" buzzwords, excessive exclamation marks |

Examples in practice:
- ✅ "This one smells like a forest after rain — mossy, grounding, completely Danish."
- ❌ "Our premium luxury scented candles are crafted with the finest ingredients!"

## Visual Identity

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Primary color | #2C4A3E (deep forest green) |
| Secondary color | #D4B896 (warm sand/cream) |
| Font style | Serif for headings (classic, trustworthy), clean sans-serif for body |
| Photography style | Natural light, linen textures, real home environments — no studio feel |
| Overall feel | Calm Scandinavian minimalism with warmth — think hygge without the clichés |

## Competitive Position

**Main competitors:**
ILLUME (international), H&M Home candles, Skandinavisk candles

**Our difference:**
We're small, local, and personal. Customers know our name and can ask us questions directly.
Our scents are inspired by specific Danish landscapes and seasons — not generic "clean" or "fresh."
We also ship within 48 hours and offer handwritten notes with every order.

## Key Differentiators

1. Genuinely Danish scents and inspiration — not Scandinavian-themed international brands
2. Small-batch, hand-poured in Copenhagen — quality over volume
3. Personal customer relationship — real person responds within hours, not days
4. Sustainable packaging: recycled materials, no plastic, minimalist design
5. Gift-ready always — every order ships gift-ready at no extra cost

## Current Goals (update regularly)

- Launch a subscription box (quarterly seasonal scents) by Q3 2026
- Grow Instagram following from 3K to 10K with consistent content
- Get stocked in 3 Copenhagen interior shops by end of 2026
- Build a wholesale section on the website for B2B orders
