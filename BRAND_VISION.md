## Mission Statement

[Why does your business exist? What change do you want to create in the world?
1-2 sentences.]

## Target Audience

[Who are your ideal customers? Be specific: age range, occupation, interests,
location, digital savviness. The more specific, the better.]

**Primary audience:**
[e.g., Small business owners in Denmark aged 30-55 who want a professional
online presence without technical complexity]

**Secondary audience (optional):**
[e.g., Freelancers and solo entrepreneurs who manage everything themselves]

## Brand Voice

[How does your brand communicate? Choose adjectives that describe your tone.]

| Quality | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Tone | [e.g., Warm and professional, never stiff or corporate] |
| Language | [e.g., Clear and jargon-free — we explain things simply] |
| Personality | [e.g., Knowledgeable friend, not a salesperson] |
| Avoid | [e.g., Overly formal language, technical jargon, pushy CTAs] |

## Visual Identity

[Describe your brand's visual style. This helps the Planner suggest appropriate
UI designs and component choices.]

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Primary color | [e.g., #1E4D8C (deep blue)] |
| Secondary color | [e.g., #F5A623 (amber)] |
| Font style | [e.g., Clean sans-serif — modern but approachable] |
| Photography style | [e.g., Real people, natural light, no stock photo feel] |
| Overall feel | [e.g., Trustworthy, modern, Scandinavian simplicity] |

## Competitive Position

[Where do you fit in the market? Who are your main competitors and how are you different?]

**Main competitors:**
[e.g., Squarespace, Wix, WordPress.com]

**Our difference:**
[e.g., We build specifically for Danish small businesses — local support,
local pricing, local language — not a one-size-fits-all global product]

## Key Differentiators

[What are the 3-5 things that make you genuinely better or different for your target audience?]

1. [e.g., Danish-language support and local market knowledge]
2. [e.g., No technical knowledge required — we handle everything]
3. [e.g., Honest, flat-rate pricing with no hidden fees]
4. [Optional]
5. [Optional]

## Current Goals (update regularly)

that support your actual business objectives.]
